# Statistics-Functions
A header file in C that contains functions to calculate some basic, and some slightly more complex statistics of a population. 

The statistics library contains functions to calcluate the mean, median, standard deviation, and kurtosis of a given number of elements in an array. The program is very flexible and dynamic because the user can choose how many elements the array will have, and then input the elements he wants. The program works on integer values as well as float values.

The main function serves simply to show how the stats.h library may be incorporated in ones code, you can change this to your preference. If you want to include this library in your own work, use the #include <stats.h> preprocessor.

## Motivation 

This project was written as part of my Fundamentals of Software Engineering Module (CSI_4_FCS) an I really enjoyed doing it. I am interested in finance and statistics and have been for a long time, after finishing this project it inspired me to create a project to display and process stock market data in Python.
